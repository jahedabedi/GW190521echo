This repository is a companions to [arXiv:2201.00047](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00047). It contains the data presented in the paper and all necessary configuration files to replicate the results. We also provide Mathematica and Pyhton and scripts for reproducing many of the plots from the publication. 

To install the Boltzmann echo waveform model with PyCBC code please use [this branch](https://github.com/jahedabedi/pycbc/tree/Boltzmann_echoes). The configuration files for PyCBC are avalable in [this branch](https://github.com/jahedabedi/GW190521echo/tree/main/PyCBC/configuration).
To get parameter files for our cWB searches please use [this branch](https://github.com/LuisFLongo/GW190521echo). The codes for doing injection study and cWB p-value estimation are stored in [this branch](https://github.com/jahedabedi/GW190521echo/tree/main/cWB). Python code to generate cross-correlation plot along with codes to generate Fig. 1 is availabel in [this branch](https://github.com/jahedabedi/GW190521echo/tree/main/figures). To keep the repository size manageable, we do not provide data for energy error estimation.
We encourage use of these data in derivative works. If you use the material provided here, please cite the paper using the reference:
